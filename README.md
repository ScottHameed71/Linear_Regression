# Linear_Regression
The case study leverages regression analysis The goal is to use EDA and regression to predict alcohol levels in wine with a relatively high accuracy.   Both *univariate* analysis* and *multivariate* regression models will be used  I am using the red wine dataset available on Kaggle, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/piyushgoyal443/red-wine-dataset).
